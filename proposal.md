# Project Description & Goals
Our idea is to extend the T-bot and create an attachment for plotting seeds in soil. This mechanism could also be used for doing things like pouring sand in specific designs or putting sprinkles on a large cake. It would work similar to how drop spreaders work. Much of the work involved in this project would be in creating and optimizing this seed-dropping mechanism works such that moderate the concentration of seeds at any area as well as stop the flow. 

We wanted to make use of materials and techniques learned in class and were interested in artistic applications of them. Partly inspired by the Telegarden —  an art project that ran from 1995 to 2004 in which online viewers could cultivate a garden using the internet —  we decided on making a seed plotter for geometric gardening. 

This extension of the T-bot is a fairly unique one. Other machines and processes that would be capable of producing similar seed/grass based designs rely on stencils for accuracy or extrude a paste of both soil and seed. Our plotter is also unique in that it accepts a certain amount of inexactness inherent from its plotting material. While we will be able to precisely and reproducibly plot paths for seed distribution, no two designs will ever be the same as the growth of each blade of grass will always be different.

One of the more difficult aspects of this project will be the milestones related to the seed dispensing mechanism, namely designing/fabricating the attachment and controlling the rate of the dispenser via G-code. Another potential challenge lies in the difficulty of troubleshooting with organic matter; it takes at least 7 days for chia seeds to germinate, and thus we won't be able to determine the accuracy of the plotter/seed dispenser immediately, as would be possible with the T-bot or a laser cutter.
