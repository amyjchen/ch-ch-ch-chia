# Project Description & Goals
Our idea is to extend the T-bot and create an attachment for plotting seeds in soil. This mechanism could also be used for doing things like pouring sand in specific designs or putting sprinkles on a large cake. It would work similar to how drop spreaders work. Much of the work involved in this project would be in creating and optimizing this seed-dropping mechanism works such that moderate the concentration of seeds at any area as well as stop the flow. 

We wanted to make use of materials and techniques learned in class and were interested in artistic applications of them. Partly inspired by the Telegarden —  an art project that ran from 1995 to 2004 in which online viewers could cultivate a garden using the internet —  we decided on making a seed plotter for geometric gardening.
